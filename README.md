# Lunar Rover Game

This is a C++ game that simulates the movement of a lunar rover on a lunar surface. The game board is a rectangular grid, and the lunar rover starts at a random position on the board. The objective of the game is to navigate the rover to the end of the board without crashing it into obstacles.

## Game Rules

1. The rover can move in four directions: up, down, left, or right.

2. The rover can only move to a new location if there is no obstacle blocking its path. The obstacles on the board include craters, rocks, and flags.

3. If the rover collides with an obstacle, it incurs damage.

4. The rover starts with a full fuel tank, which is depleted each time it moves. If the fuel runs out, the game is over.

5. If the rover reaches the end of the board, the game is won.

## Prerequisites

C++ compiler

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.

2. Compile the project using the C++ compiler.

3. Run the executable.

## Files

1. driver.cpp: This file contains the main function, which is responsible for running the game.

2. LunarRover.h and LunarRover.cpp: These files define the LunarRover class, which represents the lunar rover in the game.

3. LunarSurface.h and LunarSurface.cpp: These files define the LunarSurface class, which represents the game board.

4. Proj3_board01.txt: This file contains the layout of the game board.

5. ascii.txt: This file contains the ASCII art used in the game (bonus).

## Usage

1. Run the executable.

2. Enter the row and column coordinates of the starting position of the lunar rover.

3. Enter the direction (up, down, left, or right) in which you want to move the rover.

4. Repeat step 3 until the game is won or lost.
